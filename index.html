        <h3>My Favorite Team Sport is Portuguese Football</h3>
        <p>Football is my favorite sport because it requires a lot of running and <b>teaches cooperation
            and team work,</b> helps <b>develop positive social skills</b> and teaches respect for others.
            It helps build <b>self-confidence, a positive self-image and self-worth</b>. 
            The friendships amongst a team of football players is unlike any other sport due to
            the high volume of teammates.</p>
